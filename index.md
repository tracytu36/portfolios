### Project Samples
[Google Merchandise Store Dashboard (Google Analytics, BigQuery, BI, Tableau)](https://public.tableau.com/profile/shuchang.liang#!/vizhome/GoogleAnalyticDashboard-GoogleMerchandiseStore/Dashboard)
-	Transformed large data from session and hit levels using Google BigQuery into a unnested, relational table (1.4-million records).
-	Built a dynamic KPI dashboard which displays monthly or yearly traffic (total sessions, average pageviews, average duration on page) per source and per location, acquisition amounts per channel, and bounce rate per page.

[Online Retailer Marketing Analysis (Machine Learning, Feature Engineering, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/LTV%20%26%20Predicting%20Next%20Purchase%20Day.ipynb)
-	Performed analysis using rollup and drill down, slice and dice, sort and rank on 1 year of historical sales data for a global online retailer to compare monthly performance (e.g., growth rate, numbers of active customers, new customer ratio and retention rate, etc.)
-	Performed SWOT analysis on consumer marketing initiatives.
-	Used K-means to segment customers into 3 clusters (high, medium and low value), based on their recency, frequency and monetary values.
-	Performed customer lifetime value (CLV) analysis by using BG-NBD Model, and cohort analysis (retention over user & product lifetime).
-	A GridSearchCV tuned Random Forest multi-class Classifier (84% accuracy) was implemented to predict the CLV classes.

[Home Credit Default Risk Prediction (SQL, Machine Learning, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Home%20Credit%20Default%20Risk.ipynb)
-	Calculated credit-to-income ratio, average income, numbers of bad debt and refused accounts, etc. for 300,000 records using SQL.
-	Prepared data by removing empty records and imputing missing values, and identified features correlated to defaulted accounts.
-	Transformed categorical variables into dummy variables using one-hot encoding.
-	Implemented and compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest models, the performance of the later method was improved by 17%.

[Post Marketing Campaign Analysis (A/B Testing, BI, SQL, Python)](https://github.com/shuchangliang/Projects/blob/master/Post%20Campaign%20Analysis%20rev.1.ipynb)
-	Acquired data from marketing campaigns of a Portugal bank, and implemented data pipeline with SQL connector in Python.
-	Visualized 10,000 campaign records in Plotly, an interactive plot enables segmentation of different campaigns and other characteristics (e.g. users per age group, valid offers per day).
-	Completed conversion and retention rate analysis, determining the most effective channel which obtained highest conversion rate (34%).
-	Applied A/B testing on the email channel, the statistical significance showed the customized emails improved marketing efficiency by 39%.
